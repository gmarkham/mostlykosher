   quote:"The two bands [Mostly Kosher and the Klezmatics] share a love for preserving traditional Yiddish music and cultural traditions — sometimes with the addition of a contemporary spin — and both have enjoyed plenty of critical and audience acclaim. Still, Mostly Kosher and the Klezmatics can, to some extent, be viewed as the new klezmer kid on the block and the genre’s lion, respectively.",

   quote:"I had very little involvement in last night's sold out Invisible Hour at the Pico Union, but it was a highlight event of the year for me. I loved the music, the crowd and the energy - but most of all I loved watching really great people do their thing really well and I love what they were doing. All honor to Mostly Kosher for a superb evening!",

   quote:"Mostly Kosher shined throughout their concert at BCC, making use of their exquisite musicianship, contagious energy and poignant light-hearted humour -all of which were great ways to introduce the attendees to the sonic and spiritual experience that Klezmer music is about!",

   quote:"Mostly Kosher perfectly complimented our Jews in LA exhibit. The traditional music and songs were beautifully executed and performed. The comedy sketches disbursed among the musical performances were hilarious. Through comedy very real and moving moments representing Jewish culture were respectively brought to life.",
